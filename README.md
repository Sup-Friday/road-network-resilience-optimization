Folders:
  1. "data_processed" stores the processed (generated and almost raw) data.
  2. "shuo" stores the main methods for processing data.


All ipynb runs on the main methods in folder "shuo".
Please note, not all generated data is uploaded into this repository, but the current data is sufficient to produce all result data.
